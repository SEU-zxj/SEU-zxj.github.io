I am currently a research intern at the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, supervised by [Jiangtao Gong](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1477.htm). I am also a first-year graduate student at Tsinghua SIGS. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in computer science at Southeast University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Zhuying Li](https://zhuyingli.info/) and [Ding Ding](https://dingdingseu.mystrikingly.com/).

I have also interned at Huawei, supervised by Kailun Zhu.

My research interests lie at the intersection of world models, autonomous driving, and human-computer interaction. I enjoy exploring a broad range of topics and have worked on projects involving large language models, embodied AI, and virtual reality.

I value collaboration and enjoy communicating with othersâ€”always happy to make new friends!
